# NOTE
#
# For the includes to be executed in the correct order when they 
# have dependencies there must be one include statement. The 'needs'
# keyword does not otherwise resolve a jobs in a different include 
# file if it is in a different include block.
# I.e. I cannot do this:
#
# include:
#   - local: .gitlab/infrastructure.yml
#
# include:
#   - local: .gitlab/stage_clear_cache.yml
#
# Particularly if stage_clear_cache.yml contains jobs with the needs 
# keyword that names a job in infrastructure.yml
include:
  - local: .gitlab/stage_pipeline_serialize.yml
  - local: .gitlab/infrastructure.yml

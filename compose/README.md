# Compose Dev environment

The Compose Dev environment is split into two different Compose files. The
"core metadata services" which comprise the web server, core server and database
and the "repo services" which comprise Globus Connect Server running with the
authz library and the DataFed repo service.

NOTE Standing up the repo services has been separated because of Globus. You
will need a machine with firewall exceptions to use it.

## Core Compose Services

The following steps are used to stand up the core Compose file from scratch.
Some of steps you only have to do once.

1. Generating the env variables.
2. Opening the .env file and entering your configuration
3. Building the images
4. Running the Compose file
5. Bringing down the Compose file. 

Core services only need an external port 443 for https access. I have been 
unable to get this to work with other ports due to the redirect URL required
by Globus for authentication. It does not seem to support ports outside of 443.

### 1. Generating .env configuration varaibles for Core Services

Create the .env file fill in the missing components that are required.

```bash
./generate_env.sh
```
### 2. Fill in the needed .env variables for the Core Services

The .env file will be created in the DataFed/Compose folder and will be hidden.
The .env file variables can be changed at this point to your configuration.

NOTE the .env file will be read verbatim by Compose including any spaces or
"#" comments so do not includ anything but the exact text that needs to be
included in the variables.

### 3. Building Core Services 

The following command will build all the images to run the core metadata 
services.

```bash
./build_images_for_compose.sh
```

### 4. Running the core Compose file

Stand up the core services.

```bash
source ./unset_env.sh
docker compose -f ./compose_core.yml up
```

NOTE The unset_env.sh script is to make sure you are not accidentially
overwriting what is in the .env with your local shell env. You can check the
configuration before hand by running.

```bash
docker compose -f compose_core.yml config
```

WARNING - Docker Compose will prioritize env variables in the following priority
1. From you shell env
2. From the .env file
3. Internally from winthin the image
Be sure that you are not accidentally overwriting .env variables.

At this point you should be able to navigate in your browser to
<https://localhost>

NOTE we are using a self signed certificate so you will have to force your
browser to allow you to see the page.

### 5. Bringing down the core Compose file

To completely remove the Compose instance and all state the following should
be run.

```bash
docker compose -f ./compose_core.yml down --volumes
```

NOTE the volumes will remove all cached state. If the '--volumes' flag is
not added then on a subsequent "Compose up" the database will not be a clean
install but contain state from previous runs.

## Repo Compose Services

The following steps are used to stand up the repo Compose file. NOTE, that
because of how Globus is configured, there is an additional configuration 
and teardown step.

1. Generating the env variables.
2. Opening the .env file and entering your configuration
3. Running the generate_globus_files.sh script
4. Building the images
5. Running the Compose file
6. Bringing down the Compose file.
7. Running the cleanup_globus_files.sh if you want to remove the deployment key
   and start completely from scratch.

### 1. Generating .env configuration varaibles for the Repo Services

Create the .env file fill in the missing components that are required.

```bash
./generate_env.sh
```

### 2. Enter the .env varaibles for the Repo Services

The .env file will be created in the DataFed/Compose folder and will be hidden.
The .env file variables can be changed at this point to your configuration.

NOTE the .env file will be read verbatim by Compose including any spaces or
"#" comments so do not include anything but the exact text that needs to be
included in the variables.

### 3. Globus configuration

This step is only required once, after which the necessary files should exist
in DataFed/Compose/globus. These files will contain the Globus configuration 
needed for additional cycles of "docker compose up" and "docker compose down".

### 4. Building Repo Services 

The following command will build all the images to run the core metadata 
services.

```bash
./build_repo_images_for_compose.sh
```

### 5. Running the Repo Compose file

Stand up the repo services.

```bash
source ./unset_env.sh
docker compose -f ./compose_repo.yml up
```

Be aware, the 'source' is to apply changes to the environment of your current
terminal session.

NOTE The unset_env.sh script is to make sure you are not accidentially
overwriting what is in the .env with your local shell env. You can check the
configuration before hand by running. 

```bash
docker compose -f compose_repo.yml config
```

WARNING - Docker Compose will prioritize env variables in the following priority
1. From you shell env
2. From the .env file
3. Internally from winthin the image
Be sure that you are not accidentally overwriting .env variables.

### 6. Bringing down the Compose file 

## Cleaning up

```bash
docker compose -f ./compose_core.yml down
```

## Running isolated containers

If you just want to run a single container at a time with the same configuration
this can also be doen using commands like the following.

### DataFed Web 

```bash
source ./unset_env.sh
docker run --env-file .env \
  -e UID=$(id -u) \
  -p 443:443 \
  -p 7513:7513 \
  -t datafed-web:latest
```

### DataFed GCS

```bash
docker run --env-file .env \
  --network=host \
  -v /home/cloud/compose_collection:/mnt/datafed \
  -v ./globus:/opt/datafed/globus \
  -v ./logs:/datafed/logs \
  -v ./keys:/opt/datafed/keys \
  -t datafed-gcs:latest
```

To interact more directly with the container the '-i' flag can be added and the
entrypoint file can be overwritten by including '--entrypoint /bin/bash'

## Common Errors

### Errors during Compose up

Make sure all the ports that are needed are open on the local host. These
include, ports

443 for the datafed-web and datafed-gcs container
7512 for the datafed-core container
50000-51000 for the datafed-gcs container
9000 for the datafed-repo container
80 for the datafed-gcs container
8512 for arangodb web server interface

Make sure port 80 is not already bound on the host. Also note that the repo
server keys should exist in the keys folder before running the gcs instance.

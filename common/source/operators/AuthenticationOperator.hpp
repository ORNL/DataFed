  /**
   * Authentication Operator
   *
   * This class is designed to look at a msg buffer instance when the execute
   * command is called. It will check to see if the msg buffer is associated
   * with an authenticated user. It does this by:
   *
   * 1. Assuming that the UID stored in the MsgBuf is actually a public key.
   * 2. Comparing the public key in the MsgBuf with known keys in the Operator
   * 3. If the key is validated as an authenticated user then the UID of the
   * MsgBuf instance is updated with the user id.
   * If the key is not valid, or a uid instead of a public key is passed in,
   * then it is is prefixed with anon_ and elsewhere in the code an anonymous
   * authentication flow is run.
   *
   * In addition to checking the public key and mapping it to a user id the
   * operator will count the number of times the key is accessed (If it is
   * known).
